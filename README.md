### NoSQL_GitHub_repo_analysis
This is a data analysis project rating community activity in GitHub repositories using GitHub Search API, MongoDB (atlas cloud), and pymongo.

When checking whether one should use a certain third-party library, an often considered factor is the activity of the community maintaning the library. In technical discussions about which framework should be used for a project, statements like "the community is very active" is also likely to be used as a pro argument. But can we derive KPIs by using repository data for libraries hosted on github to rate activity and maintenace objectively? Let us find out by using the GitHub Search API.
We will analyze the pymongo repository on GitHub (mongodb/mongo-python-driver).
